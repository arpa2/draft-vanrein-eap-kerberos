# draft-vanrein-eap-kerberos

> *Kerberos in the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP-Kerberos)*

**DEPRECATED** in favour of [EAP-SASL](https://github.com/arpa2/draft-vanrein-eap-sasl) with a topping of [IAKERB](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-kitten-iakerb-03) &mdash; as that is a much cleaner solution, more orthogonally getting the right things into the right place.

Take note: IAKERB is a draft waiting for someone to get active about it, and push it through the hoops that all drafts need to be pushed through.
