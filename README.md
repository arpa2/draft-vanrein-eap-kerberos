# draft-vanrein-eap-kerberos
Kerberos in the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP-Kerberos)

**DEPRECATED** in favour of [https://github.com/arpa2/draft-vanrein-eap-sasl](EAP-SASL) with a topping of [https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-kitten-iakerb-03](IAKERB) &mdash; as that is a much cleaner solution, more orthogonally getting the right things into the right place.

Do note however: IAKERB is a draft waiting for someone to get active about it, and push it through the hoops that all drafts need to be pushed through.
